## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide a standardized way for AI agents to interact with external services and blockchain protocols. Our MCP server collection includes:

## MCP Server Collection

Our MCP server collection includes:

- **mcp-abi**: Dynamic smart contract ABI interactions for Ethereum-compatible blockchains
- **mcp-near**: NEAR Protocol blockchain integration with AI-driven event processing
- **mcp-fraxlend**: Fraxlend lending protocol integration
- **mcp-odos**: Decentralized exchange aggregation
- **mcp-atp**: IQ AI Agent Tokenization Platform integration

## Installation Methods

All MCP servers support three installation methods:

### 1. Using pnpm dlx (Recommended)

Run directly without installation:

```bash
pnpm dlx <package-name>
```

### 2. Global Installation

```bash
pnpm add -g <package-name>
```

### 3. From Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

## Security Considerations

### Private Key Management

- **Never commit private keys to version control**
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Secure your MCP client configuration files** with appropriate file permissions
- **Consider using hardware wallets** or secure key management services for production environments

### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS endpoints** for all API calls
- **Validate all inputs** before processing
- **Implement proper error handling** to prevent information leakage
- **Monitor transaction activity** for suspicious behavior

### Best Practices

- **Use testnet environments** for development and testing
- **Set appropriate gas limits** to prevent runaway costs
- **Implement proper logging** without exposing sensitive data
- **Regularly update dependencies** to patch security vulnerabilities
- **Use least privilege principle** for API keys and permissions

## Error Handling

All MCP servers implement comprehensive error handling:

- **Invalid parameters** are caught and reported with helpful messages
- **Network failures** are handled gracefully with retry mechanisms
- **Blockchain errors** are properly formatted and returned to clients
- **Authentication issues** are clearly identified and communicated
- **Rate limiting** is respected and communicated to prevent service interruptions

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging

- All servers provide detailed logging of operations
- Error messages include context and troubleshooting guidance
- Performance metrics are tracked and available through specific tools

### Health Checks

- Servers implement health check endpoints
- Connection status to blockchain networks is monitored
- Service availability is tracked and reported
